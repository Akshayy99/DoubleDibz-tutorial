         <hr>
         <p>Poor and broke? Can’t afford new things? You’ve come to the right place! At DoublDibz you can find hundreds of nice things at cheap prices from people in your community. </p>
         <p>We were college students who lived the typical college life. We ate Ramen 24/7 and bought all of our furniture and books from friends and on Craigslist. We were dissatisfied with the amount of scams on Craigslist but it was the only option at the time. Suddenly, a holy light shined down on us and presented itself. It was the Facebook group “Free and for Sale”. Now we could sell or give away our stuff to people in our community. We knew that we were dealing with legit people because these guys went to our school. After the initial honeymoon phase, we came to the realization that this was just a wall post and not a full fledged peer to peer trading network. It lacks categorization, organization, and presentation. We decided to build a website to improve on the core concept of the “Free and for Sale” group and to enhance the peer to peer trading network.</p>
         
         <p>There are two kinds of posts on our site: those created on our site and those created on Facebook. Posts created on our site can be categorized by adding hashtags in their posts. This increases the chance that their post will be found with the search tool. Potential buyers are able to contact sellers directly through the use of the in house chat that functions similarly to Facebook chat. Chats are separated by items to make keeping track of conversations simple. Almost any activity done on our site will notify the user on Facebook!</p>
         <p>The second type of posts comes directly from the Facebook group “Free and for Sale”. These posts are indicated by the Facebook logo on the bottom left corner of every image. When someone clicks on a Facebook post, they will be linked to the Free and for Sale listing on Facebook. Users need to be a part of the Free and for Sale group to be able to see or comment on any Facebook post. We do not store/display/ or give away private user information.</p>
         <p>We’re doing our best to improve the peer to peer selling experience. If you have any comments, feedback, or concerns, we will be more than happy to chat with you. You can contact us at customerservice@DoubleDibz.com</p>
